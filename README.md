# My Website
This is my personal website/portfolio built with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework and styled with the [Blowfish theme](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish). I'll post from time to time on any topics or projects I might find interesting, mostly relating to technology.

## Features

This theme includes:
- A layout designed with Tailwind CSS 3.0.
- Dark and light mode support.
- Highly customizable settings, with various color schemes.
- Option to buy me [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/carterpry)
- Support for multilingual content and even RSS integration.

## Installation
To run this site locally, you'll need to have Hugo installed on your machine. For detailed instructions, refer to Hugo's official [documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

1. **Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/TheRepoYouChose
cd yourwebsite
```

2. **Initialize and update submodules (for the Blowfish theme):**
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

3. **Start the Hugo server:**
```
hugo server -D
```


Then you should be able to find your local test at `http://localhost:1313` in your web browser.
