## ChatpGPT 
[Open AI](https://openai.com/) has recently come out with one of the most advanced Artificial Intelligence Chatbots. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) came out Nov 30 of 2022, and in about 5 days it easily reached over 1 million users. This advanced chatbot is free and open for any of your questions, with almost a guaranteed answer following a human-like response.

## How does it work
The chatbot was made with the [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/) language model and trained with massive amounts of data to answer with various outputs in different styles or formats based on the question asked. The AI improved with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Multiple trainers would ask the AI questions but also assist the AI into providing good responses. With the different responses that were received, trainers were also tasked with the job of ranking different responses. This was to create the reward environment to implement the [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)](https://openai.com/blog/openai-baselines-ppo/#ppo) reinforcement learning algorithm. In other words the ChatGPT was trained to know what good responses are and which responses it shouldn't put out, including scenarios where it cannot answer the prompt.

## Limitations
Though it may seem as if it has all the answers to the high amount of questions being asked, it is still limited. If worded a certain way, even by a very small change from another prompt it may not be able to answer one but can cooperate with the other. This is something OpenAI is working on, along with feeding it more information to answer with. The information it currently has is the other large limitation that holds it back from cooperation. It has been given a massive amount of data, but only from places like archived books or wiki. There does seem to be an assumption from many that it pulls answers from the web, however that is not the case and only pulls from its own resources

## History
As stated earlier ChatGPT was released Nov 30, of 2022, however it was based on other AI models that were also developed by OpenAI. ChatpGPT is built off the GPT-3.5 series, similar yet different to the GPT-3 model. The GPT-3 is actually faster than the ChatGPT, yet not as useful for setting up as a chatbot on a website.

## What the chat thinks of himself
Maybe you're interested in what it thinks of itself. This is the response it gave me to the question, "What is ChatGPT?"

## GPT-4
Though this new and revolutionary GPT project is extremely impressive, we can still look into the next version. The even more human-like robot, GPT-4. GPT-3 was made with 175 Billion Parameters (Learning rate, layers for the AI, etc.), in other words it’s extremely complex, the more parameters the better. Though GPT-3 has that many, GPT-4 which is expected to release in 2023 blows it’s antecessors out of the water with 100 Trillion Parameters. Definitely going to be an interesting project where over 1 million people will be playing with this masterpiece over their browser. Personally I cannot wait for the next big version of ChatGPT, especially if there is a chance for it to be implemented with this futuristic GPT version. The potential for this project is large and extremely exciting. Soon enough the GPT-3 will look like nothing and the time for confusing robots and humans finally will begin.
